A curricular tool integrated into many academic disciplines on campus, the Garden serves as a living classroom for many classes. With 3.6 acres, a wide variety of plants, growing techniques, soil systems, and produce, we are host to a variety of activities, including classes, events, field trips and research. The garden is a vital hub for health, wellness and a connection to our environment.</p> -->
    <p> We would like to start this event by acknowledging that the room we are in rests on the traditional village sites of the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, bands of the Chinook, Tualatin Kalapuya, Molalla and many other Tribes who made their homes along the Columbia River. Multnomah is a band of Chinooks that lived in this area.
We thank the descendants of these Tribes for being the original stewards and protectors of these lands since time immemorial. We also acknowledge that Portland, OR has the 9th largest Urban Native American population in the U.S. with over 380 federally recognized Tribes represented in the Urban Portland Metropolitan area. We also acknowledge the systemic policies of genocide, relocation, and assimilation that still impact many Indigenous/Native American families today.
We are honored by the collective work of many Native Nations, leaders and families who are demonstrating resilience, resistance, revitalization, healing and creativity. We are honored to be guests upon these lands. Thank you, and thanks also to our colleagues at the Portland State University Indigenous Nations Studies Program for crafting this acknowledgement. </p>

    <h3>Who they were</h3>
    <p> The Atfalati or Tualatin tribe of the Kalapuya group of native americans settled in current Washington County roughly ten thousand years ago. They were mostly wiped out by disease in the late 1700’s to early 1800’s. Those that were left, were forced to move onto the Grande Ronde reservation in 1855 after a treaty was signed with the U.S. Government. For hundreds of years the Atfalati camped in an oak meadow called Chatakuin near Helvetia, which means place of the big trees and is the current historic site known as Five Oaks.</p>

    <h3>Their culture</h3>
    <p>The Kalapuya were a migrant people during the summer moving across the Tualatin valley to seasonal food sources and during the cold winter months they lived in large multi-family houses. They were organized into various groups of hunters and gatherers and made most products they needed at home. Other items they might need were procured through trade or attacking other native americans. When they would win a battle they would take survivors as slaves. They used these slaves for trade as well as manufacturing of items needed for the tribe. Horses were also important to the Kalapuya and the more slaves and horses you owned, the richer that you were considered. The richer you were, the more important you were considered and you might become chief. Not only did they have chiefs, but they also had shamans which were considered the head of their religious beliefs.</p>
<h4>Plants</h4>
<p> As mentioned before, the Atfalati were hunters and gatherers. They would do organized burns across the Tualatin Valley to keep forests and underbrush from forming and making it more ideal for deer and elk. This would also encourage the growth of some plants including some which can be found in the Learning Garden. They were known for gathering the following  </p>
<div class="open-sesame">
<h4>Camas</h4>
<p> the bulbs were dried and cooked. After it was cooked, the Atfalati would grind it into a flour that was used to make cakes that were stored for winter.</p>
<h4>Blueberries</h4>
<p>Hydroponics is a method of growing plants that does not require soil. Instead, the plant roots are supported in an inert medium, like rockwool, perlite, clay pellets, peat moss, or vermiculite. The roots touch a water-based nutrient solution that is pumped through the system, but still have plenty of access to oxygen.<img class="alignright size-percent-50 wp-image-1609" src="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/10/hydroponics6.16-250x227.jpg" alt="Hydroponics" srcset="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/10/hydroponics6.16-250x227.jpg 250w, https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/10/hydroponics6.16.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p>PCC Rock Creek&#8217;s hydroponics include a Nutrient Film Technique system and a Dutch Bucket system as the result of a collaborative project between the Garden, the Landscape Technology <em>Propagation</em> and Environmental Studies<em> Introduction to Closed Systems</em> classes. Maintained and harvested by the Learning Garden staff and volunteers, the produce grown via hydroponics is sold at <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/on-campus/rock-creek/portlandia-farmstandia/">Portlandia FarmStandia</a>.</p>
<h4>Golden Currant</h4>
<p>The Learning Garden has partnered with the Landscape Technology (LAT) program and maintains 12 raised beds in the LAT hoop house (also called a “high tunnel”) to extend the Garden’s growing season. One of the focal points in the hoophouse is the salad garden, with lettuces and greens grown to supply the PCC Dining Services with a consistent source of salad for the College cafeterias and catering jobs. The raised beds are constructed with wood from Juniper, a conifer invasive to Oregon. Juniper is considered a sustainable construction material because of it&#8217;s extremely durable nature and the process used to harvest it helps mitigate its invasive nature. Inside the hoop house, solar radiation warms the soil temperature in the raised beds throughout the winter. This allows the Garden to extend its growing season to support year-round production.</p>
<h4>Indian Hemp</h4>
<p>Since the Garden&#8217;s inception in 2006 it has generated consistently increasing harvests measured by both weight and by crop variety. In 2016, the Garden harvest exceeded 8,850 pounds of food and included 208 distinct varieties of produce. Crops include carrots, tomatoes, peppers, cilantro, grapes, beets, winter squash, apples, popcorn, arugula, kiwi, parsley, oregano, spinach, blueberries, radishes, basil and more. Produce is harvested from April through October and the majority of the produce is sold at <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/on-campus/rock-creek/portlandia-farmstandia/">Portlandia FarmStandia</a> or to the College&#8217;s Dining Services to be incorporated into the cafeteria menus or used in catering jobs.</p>
<h4>Mariposa Lily</h4>
<p>We have over 50 blueberry bushes in the Learning Garden. Varieties include Bluecrop, Chandler, Patriot, Jersey, and Duke. These blueberries are covered with a green net so that we get the berries before the birds! We raise the nets in the spring allowing the bees to pollinate, and pull them down when the bushes start producing. Blueberries harvested are sold at <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/on-campus/rock-creek/portlandia-farmstandia/">Portlandia FarmStandia</a>.</p>
<h4>Bulrush</h4>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1610" src="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/10/appleblossom5.17-coralavery.jpg" alt="Orchard" srcset="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/10/appleblossom5.17-coralavery.jpg 500w, https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2017/10/appleblossom5.17-coralavery-250x167.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />The Learning Garden is host to an orchard consisting of 67 trees including apple, pawpaw, elderberry, mulberry, pluot, cherry, fig, peach, nectarine, persimmon, asian pear, and pear. The orchard provides pollination for our bees, harvest for the farm stand and cafeteria, and educational opportunities for our students.</p>
<h4>Bitterroot</h4>
<p>The cane fruit field is one of the more recently established features of the Garden. Planted in 2015, our cane fruits include raspberries, blackberries and marionberries. Grapes are also planted in this area. This part of the Garden is slated for moderate expansion in the near future. As with our other produce, fruits harvested are directed to <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/sustainability/on-campus/rock-creek/portlandia-farmstandia/">Portlandia FarmStandia</a> or the College&#8217;s Dining Services.</p>
