    <h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>    
    <p>
    We thank the descendants of the Kalapuya, Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Molalla, and many other tribes for being the original stewards and protectors of these lands since time immemorial. We also acknowledge that Portland, OR has the 9th largest Urban Native American population in the U.S. with over 380 federally recognized Tribes represented in the Urban Portland Metropolitan area. We also acknowledge the systemic policies of genocide, relocation, and assimilation that still impact many Indigenous/Native American families today.<br><br>
    We are honored by the collective work of many Native Nations, leaders and families who are demonstrating resilience, resistance, revitalization, healing and creativity. We are honored to be guests upon these lands. Thank you, and thanks also to our colleagues at the <a href='https://www.pdx.edu/nas/indigenous-nations-studies' target='__blank'>Portland State University Indigenous Nations Studies</a> program for crafting the above acknowledgement.<br><br>
This land acknowledgement helps create a conversation about the treatment of the indigenous people that were here before and can hopefully be seen as a start to showing our gratitude for their sacrifices.  The various Kalapuya tribes had to use sustainability in their treatment of these lands as well as collaboration among tribes. Without following these ideals they would not have survived for thousands of years. These are the same ideals that the Rock Creek Learning Garden tries to represent and teach to students as well as the community.
    </p>
    <h3>The People</h3>
    <p>
    The Atfalati or Tualatin tribe of the Kalapuya group of Native Americans settled in current Washington County roughly ten thousand years ago. They were mostly wiped out by disease in the late 1700’s to early 1800’s. Those that were left, were forced to move onto the Grande Ronde reservation in 1855 after a treaty was signed with the U.S. Government. <br><br>

    The Kalapuya were a migrant people during the summer moving across the Willamette valley to seasonal food sources and during the cold winter months they lived in large multi-family houses. They were organized into various groups of hunters and gatherers and made most products they needed at home. Other items they might need were procured through trade or attacking other Native Americans. When they would win a battle they would take survivors as slaves. They used these slaves for trade as well as manufacturing of items needed for the tribe. Horses were also important to the Kalapuya and the more slaves and horses you owned, the richer that you were considered. The richer you were, the more important you were considered and you might become chief. Not only did they have chiefs, but they also had shamans which were considered the head of their religious beliefs.<br><br>

    More information can be found at the <a target='__blank' href='http://www.washingtoncountymuseum.org/home/exhibits/kalapuya/'>Washington County Museum</a> on the Rock Creek campus of PCC.

    </p>


    <h3>The Agriculture</h3>
    <p>
    As mentioned before, the Atfalati were hunters and gatherers. They would do organized burns across the Willamette Valley to keep forests and underbrush from forming and making it more ideal for deer and elk. This would also encourage the growth of some plants including some which can be found in the Learning Garden. They were known for gathering the following plants:
