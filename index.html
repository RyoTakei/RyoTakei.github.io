A curricular tool integrated into many academic disciplines on campus, the Garden serves as a living classroom for many classes. With 3.6 acres, a wide variety of plants, growing techniques, soil systems, and produce, we are host to a variety of activities, including classes, events, field trips and research. The garden is a vital hub for health, wellness and a connection to our environment.</p> -->
    <p> We would like to start this event by acknowledging that the room we are in rests on the traditional village sites of the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, bands of the Chinook, Tualatin Kalapuya, Molalla and many other Tribes who made their homes along the Columbia River. Multnomah is a band of Chinooks that lived in this area.
We thank the descendants of these Tribes for being the original stewards and protectors of these lands since time immemorial. We also acknowledge that Portland, OR has the 9th largest Urban Native American population in the U.S. with over 380 federally recognized Tribes represented in the Urban Portland Metropolitan area. We also acknowledge the systemic policies of genocide, relocation, and assimilation that still impact many Indigenous/Native American families today.
We are honored by the collective work of many Native Nations, leaders and families who are demonstrating resilience, resistance, revitalization, healing and creativity. We are honored to be guests upon these lands. Thank you, and thanks also to our colleagues at the Portland State University Indigenous Nations Studies Program for crafting this acknowledgement. </p>

    <h3>Who they were</h3>
    <p> The Atfalati or Tualatin tribe of the Kalapuya group of native americans settled in current Washington County roughly ten thousand years ago. They were mostly wiped out by disease in the late 1700’s to early 1800’s. Those that were left, were forced to move onto the Grande Ronde reservation in 1855 after a treaty was signed with the U.S. Government. For hundreds of years the Atfalati camped in an oak meadow called Chatakuin near Helvetia, which means place of the big trees and is the current historic site known as Five Oaks.</p>

    <h3>Their culture</h3>
    <p>The Kalapuya were a migrant people during the summer moving across the Tualatin valley to seasonal food sources and during the cold winter months they lived in large multi-family houses. They were organized into various groups of hunters and gatherers and made most products they needed at home. Other items they might need were procured through trade or attacking other native americans. When they would win a battle they would take survivors as slaves. They used these slaves for trade as well as manufacturing of items needed for the tribe. Horses were also important to the Kalapuya and the more slaves and horses you owned, the richer that you were considered. The richer you were, the more important you were considered and you might become chief. Not only did they have chiefs, but they also had shamans which were considered the head of their religious beliefs.</p>
<h3>Plants</h4>
<p> As mentioned before, the Atfalati were hunters and gatherers. They would do organized burns across the Tualatin Valley to keep forests and underbrush from forming and making it more ideal for deer and elk. This would also encourage the growth of some plants</p>

<h5> Here at the Learning Garden...</h5>
<p> To bring their culture to PCC learning gardenm, we have implemented Kalapuya culture to showcase what they have. Here are some of plants you can find at the learning garden.

<h4>Camas</h4>
<p> the bulbs were dried and cooked. After it was cooked, the Atfalati would grind it into a flour that was used to make cakes that were stored for winter.</p>

<p>these berries are common in North America and considered healthy.
